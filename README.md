# F&M Algorithms
A repository containing various algorithms for generating data for boards of the Factors and Multiples game.

The Factors and Multiples game is a game played on a board of integers 1 through n, where two players take turns taking an untaken number that is either a factor or a multiple of the previous player's number. The player who goes first can freely choose where to start. A player is declared the winner if the next player has no more moves.
